\usage{
diag_stability(
  modelBiomass,
  initialYr = 1964,
  speciesCodes,
  nYrs = 20,
  sigTest = 0.05,
  plot = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelBiomass}{A data frame. Total biomass of all groups over time, read in from
Atlantis ...BioInd.txt output using \code{atlantisom::load_bioind}.}

\item{initialYr}{Numeric Scalar. Year in which the model run was initiated. (Default = 1964)}

\item{speciesCodes}{Character vector. A vector of Atlantis species codes in which to test for stability.
(Default = NULL, uses all species found in  \code{modelBiomass})}

\item{nYrs}{Numeric scalar. Number of years from the end of the time series that stability must occur.
(Default = 20 years)}

\item{sigTest}{Numeric Scalar. alpha level to use to test for slope significance (Default = 0.05)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Specifying whether the function should generate plots or not. (Default is F).}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of all species and how they measure up against the stability criterion
\item{code}{Atlantis Code for species/functional group}
\item{species}{The common name of the species/functional group}
\item{t1Biomass}{Value of biomass for first years data used in the fit}
\item{relChange}{Rate of increase relative to \code{t1Biomass}(\code{mtperyear}/\code{t1Biomass})}
\item{mtperyear}{Double. The value of the slope parameter (year) }
\item{pValue}{Double. The p-value associated with the slope parameter (time)}
\item{pass}{Logical. Does the species/group pass the test for stability}
}
\description{
\code{diag_stability} determines whether the model reaches a steady state
over the last n years of a run. Stability is loosely defined as a species/groups biomass reaching a
stable level (measured as having no trend in a defined time range).
}
\section{Details}{


Formally the following model is fit to the last n years of the run:

\deqn{biomass_t = \mu + \beta.t + \epsilon_t  where \epsilon_t ~ IID N(0,\sigma^2)}

where null hypothesis,  \deqn{H0:\beta=0}

Note: annual biomass is used in fitting.

\dontrun{
# Declare paths to files required
biol.file <- "neus_outputBiomIndx.txt"
file_fgs <- "neus_groups.csv"
# use atlantisom to read them in
fgs <- atlantisom::load_fgs(inDir,file_fgs)

# Perform stability test on all species/groups using the last 20 years of the run
diag_stability(modelBiomass, nYrs = 20)

# Only perform test on herring and white hake.
# Require stability over the last 10 years of the run and and use alpha = 0.1 as tests significance level
