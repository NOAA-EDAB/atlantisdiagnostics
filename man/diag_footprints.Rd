\title{Compares the redistribution footprints for groups in the model}
\usage{
diag_footprints(paramList, speciesCodes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{paramList}{A list of parameter files (Output of \code{get_atl_paramfiles()})}

\item{speciesCodes}{A character string of the species/group name of interest. Default is NULL (All species)}
}
\value{
A data frame. Only groups that fail are returned. The columns are:
\item{group}{Species/Group name}
\item{layer}{Polygon layer}
\item{recruitBoxes}{Proportion of boxes that are not habitable for recruits due to temperature (relative to defined range)}
\item{ageBoxesAdult}{Proportion of boxes that are not habitable for adults due to temperature (relative to defined range)}
\item{ageBoxesJuv}{Proportion of boxes that are not habitable for juveniles due to temperature (relative to defined range)}
\item{recruitTime}{Proportion of time in model that recruits were distributed away from non habitable polygons}
\item{ageTimeAdult}{Proportion of time in model that adults were distributed away from non habitable polygons}
\item{ageTimeJuv}{Proportion of time in model that juveniles were distributed away from non habitable polygons}
\item{pass}{Logical indicating if the species passes the temperature threshold test. All fields < 0.01}
}
\description{
Determine if Groups have the sam footprint for timestep redistribution
Horizontal redistribution proportions (FXXX_SY and recruit_hdist) and
vertical distributions (vertDAY,vertNIGHT, recruit_vdistrib) are used to
compare the spatial extent of the groups.
