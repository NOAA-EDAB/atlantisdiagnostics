\item{speciesStats}{Data frame. Must contain at least 3 columns labeled \code{code} - Atlantis species codes
,\code{maxObsWeight} - a value (g) indicating the maximum weight the species should weigh,
\code{maxObsLength} - a value (cm) indicating the maximum length the species should grow to.}

\item{speciesCodes}{Character vector. A vector of Atlantis species codes in which to test for large fish.
(Default = NULL, uses all species)}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame indicating which species meet defined max weight/length criterion.

\item{species}{The common name of the species/functional group}
\item{code}{Atlantis Code for species/functional group}
\item{polygon}{Polygon in which the largest individual occupies}
\item{agecl}{Age class of the largest individual}
\item{time}{Time in which the largest individual was found (Decimal years)}
\item{maxLength}{Maximum length of species in Atlantis (cm)}
\item{maxObsLength}{Maximum observed length of species (cm) - from litereature }
\item{maxMeanWeight}{Maximum mean weight of indivdual in Atlantis (g)}
\item{maxObsWeight}{Maximum observed weight of species (g) - from litereature}
\item{passW}{Boolean indicating whether species maximum weight (from Atlantis) falls below max observed weight}
\item{ratioW}{ratio of atlantis max weight to observed max weight}
\item{passL}{Boolean indicating whether species maximum length (from Atlantis) falls below max observed length}
\item{ratioL}{ratio of atlantis max length to observed max length}

\description{
Calculate average size of fish through time and check to see if any fish exceed the
user supplied observed maximum size. Both maximum weight and maximum length are used
}
