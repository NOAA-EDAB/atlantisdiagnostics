\item{nYrs}{Numeric scalar. Number of years from the end of the time series that stability must occur.}

\item{min.dist}{Numeric Scalar. Maximum distance between model and reference center of gravity}

\item{relChangeThreshold}{Numeric Scalar. Maximum magnitude of relative change of slope (Default = 0.01)}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of all species and how they measure up against the catch by fleet criteria
\item{species}{The common name of the species/functional group}
\item{fleet}{The fleet name from the fisheries file}
\item{catch.model}{Double. The mean catch in mT over the last nYrs of the model }
