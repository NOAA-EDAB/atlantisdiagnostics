\title{Test for all functional group persistence}
\usage{
diag_persist(atBtxt, fgs.names, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{atBtxt}{A dataframe of total biomass of all groups over time, read in from
Atlantis ...BioInd.txt output using \code{atlantisom::load_bioind}.}

\item{fgs.names}{A vector of species names}

\item{plot}{A logical value specifying if the function should generate plots or
not. The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe of crashed species with columns "Failed" of species
names and "nYrs0B" with number of years having 0 biomass. Also plots all species
trajectories with red lines for crashed years unless plot=FALSE.
}
\description{
\code{diag_persist} Averages over a year to see if mean B is 0,
assuming that initial (Time = 0) biomass does not count. Output is a list of
species that have crashed and an optional set of plots where 0 biomass is red.
}
\details{
This should be run on an unfished, unperturbed run. Fishing or
perturbations may legitimately drive groups extinct. However, for our
historical period, we donâ€™t expect anything to go extinct that is in the
system now, so this test includes historical fishing, physics, and
phytoplankton drivers.
