Atlantis model performance diagnostics guided by Kaplan and Marshall<sup>1</sup>, 2016

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("NOAA-EDAB/atlantisdiagnostics")
```

## Usage

The diagnostics package primarily focuses on three properties of an Atlantis model. These are loosely defined as persistence, stability, and reasonability.

* Persistence: Do all species/groups in the model persist through a set period of time,
* Stability: Do all species/groups reach an acceptable steady state or equilibrium?
* Reasonability: Do all species/groups population biomass lie within reasonable bounds?
