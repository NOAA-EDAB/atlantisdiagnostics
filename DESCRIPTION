Description: Atlantis diagnostics functions in this package are used to determine whether the model 
    is meeting defined performance and review criteria, including persistence of all functional groups,
    biomass stability for the last ~20 years of a run, species groups 
    totaling ~80% of system biomass qualitatively matching known biomass trends, patterns of temporal 
    variability are captured, productivity for groups totaling ~80% of system biomass qualitatively 
    matching FMSY or life history expectations, natural mortality decreasing with age for most groups,
    age and length structure qualitatively matching expectations for majority of groups, and predicted
    diet qualitatively matching empirical diet comp for majority of groups.
